# deal.II-preCICE adapter

![Building](https://github.com/precice/dealii-adapter/workflows/Building/badge.svg)

Coupled structural solvers written with the C++ finite element library deal.II:

- `source/linear_elasticity` contains a linear-elastic solver based on the [step-8 tutorial program](https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_8.html) of deal.II
- `source/nonlinear_elasticity` contains a nonlinear elastic solver, which builds on previous work of Jean-Paul Pelteret and Andrew McBride in their deal.II code gallery program '[Quasi-Static Finite-Strain Compressible Elasticity](https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/code_gallery_Quasi_static_Finite_strain_Compressible_Elasticity.html).' This solver supports shared-memory parallelization.

Applied coupling functionalities have been separated and can be found in the `include/adapter` directory.
